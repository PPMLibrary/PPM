ppm_psendbuffer contains indeces to the first particle of the k-th communication
partner to send to.
ppm_precvbuffer contains indeces to the first particle of the k-th communication
partner to receive from.
ppm_buffer2part stores the original indeces of the particles
ppm_ghost_offsets, ppm_ghost_offsetd store the offsets of ghost particles to
allow for boundary condition particles

ppm_ghosthack ?

how to send back new local ghosts to their "native" sub without getting them
back later and causing duplications:
- do the modify_send in 2 rounds
- first do a "put"
  - send the new ghosts to the sub where they are real
  - when receiving them, the psend_buffer and buffer2part have to be updated
  - while updating those arrays, we maintain an additional array storing the
    offset of the new particles within buffer2part (sendbuffers?).
    psend_put_offset
- then we do a "get"
  - we now send all particles from psend_new_offset to psend_put_offset.



%SR:
in ppm_map_part_ghost_get.f:
   the variable prev_allocsize does not seem to be initialized before it is used (nor after...)
   Check if that could be a small bug....
